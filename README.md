Abstract:

Using one of the most adapted texts in history, Robinson Crusoe, we ask whether or not a computer can find adaptations that scholars have yet to identify. Through testing the effectiveness of different machine learning techniques for text embedding on small groups of full-length texts, we determine the best model for our task, the universal sentence encoder, and then use it to build a deep neural network based binary classifier trained on a large dataset of adaptation and random texts. We attempt to implicitly teach the computer the plot of Crusoe, instead of making decisions based on stylistic details, as is a pitfall of traditional techniques. We hope this novel pipeline will help other scholars work with large units of text at the plot - level.
